# GFDecompress

* DataUtil.cs: various data conversion classes
* JsonUtil.cs: converts to JSON format
* StcBinaryReader.cs: decrypts files
* Downloader.cs: downloads JP/EN/KR/CN files
* Program.cs: main program

The .format files in the STCFormat folder contain the names for each name-value pair in the JSON. These may need to be updated over time (see: [girlsfrontline-deobfuscator](https://github.com/neko-gg/girlsfrontline-deobfuscator))

At least from my testing (note: most of my coding experience is with VBA), Python 3.8 with the unitypack package is needed.
